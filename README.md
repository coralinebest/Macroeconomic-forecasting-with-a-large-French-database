# Macroeconomic-forecasting-with-a-large-French-database

**Repository: Macro-Forecasting**

### Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a macroeconomic forecasting project focusing on predicting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in France. The project employs various machine learning models, including Elastic Net, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression, to analyze a large French monthly macroeconomic dataset. The forecasting exercise involves evaluating the models' performance, interpreting forecasts, and retrieving prediction intervals.

### Introduction
The report begins with background information on the history of inflation in France and the significance of forecasting inflation in macroeconomic policy. A literature review explores the use of machine learning models and large datasets for macroeconomic forecasting.

### Materials and Methods
This section covers the presentation of the data, details about the models used (Elastic Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, ARMA), and additional methods employed such as conformal prediction, PCA, PLS, Augmented Dickey Fuller test, and Diebold Mariano test. It provides insights into the empirical strategies and model tuning, including the forecasting set-up.

### Results
Detailed results include descriptive statistics, the outcome of predictive analysis, and insights into variable importance.
